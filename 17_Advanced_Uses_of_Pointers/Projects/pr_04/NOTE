Modify the justify program of section 15.3 by rewriting line.c file so that
it sotres the current line in a linked list. Each node in the list will
store a single word. The linr array will be replaced by a pointer variable
that points to the node containing the first word. This variable will store
a null pointer whenever the line is empty.


I DID NOT DO THIS...IT IS UNMODIFIED.
